        <p>
            First released to the world in the second half of 2022, Trek is the latest big industry player to debut an
            e-mountain bike that favours a lightweight battery, lower output motor and ride characteristics similar to
            that of an analogue trail bike.
        </p>

        <p>
            Named the Fuel EXe, the lightweight e-bike is based on the brand's wildly popular Fuel EX line of trail
            bikes and features a host of similarities to its unpowered sibling. In this video, we’ll take you through
            what we liked, what we didn’t and exactly who this modern trail e-mountain bike is aimed at.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>Who’s it for?:</span> Anyone in the market for an e-mountain bike that is so similar to a traditional
            mountain bike in terms of its ride characteristics that it's almost imperceptible aside from where it
            counts.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>What’s it cost?:</span> AU$9,499.99, As tested.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>What we liked:</span> The drive unit and battery system are up there with the best we’ve experienced,
            excellent ride characteristics and playful geometry.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>What we didn’t:</span> Entry-level components let the bike down, as does the lack of adjustable
            suspension at the frame and fork.
        </p>

        <p>
            While Trek isn’t the first brand to release a lightweight e-mountain bike, the Fuel EXe represents a
            significant shift in how brands approach e-mountain bikes. When first introduced, the e-mountain bike was
            all about being big. Big batteries, big power outputs, long wheelbases, and big weight. While there is still
            a place for these more traditional rigs, nowadays, riders are seeking something that offers the benefits of
            an e-bike without the downsides, and with the Fuel EXe, Trek may have nailed that brief.
        </p>

        <p>
            The mechanical components of the Fuel EXe mirror that of a traditional, modern trail bike. The steed rolls
            on 29-inch hoops wrapped with 2.5” rubber front and rear, while 150mm of suspension is found at the fork,
            with 140mm of rear travel also present, slightly up on the regular Fuel EX. Trail-spec specific 4-piston
            brake callipers are found across the entire range, with our 9.5 model using post-mounted Tektro Orion 4P
            callipers front and rear.
        </p>

        <p>
            12-speed drivetrains also feature across the entire range, with our entry-level unit utilising a Shimano
            Deore 1x set-up mated to an eThirteen Espec 34T crankset. Out back, an 11-51T cassette provides a wide
            spread of gears.
        </p>

        <p>
            Touchpoints come courtesy of the in-house brand, Bontrager, with a 750mm wide alloy bar, 50mm stem, and
            MTB-specific Arvada saddle all featuring. A TransX dropper seatpost with 170mm of travel on our Size Medium
            test bike finishes the build.
        </p>

        <p>
            Making full use of the lack of compromise needed with the svelte drive unit and battery, the geometry of the
            Fuel EXe is best described as balanced. Highlights include a 440mm chainstay length, which is impressive
            given the bike's ability to take 27.5” and 29er wheels and its 2.5” worth of tyre clearance. The rear wheel
            uses a Boost 148 standard, so the chainline won’t feel too quirky if you’re coming from an analogue trail
            bike.
        </p>

        <p>
            Much like the regular Fuel EX, the EXe uses Trek’s Mino link, allowing riders to adjust the bike's geometry
            if their ride style, bike set-up or trails dictate. While admittedly, we found the standard 64.7º head
            angle, 76.7º seat angle and 38.5mm drop adequate for our needs, steepening the angles by 0.5º and raising
            the bottom bracket by 7mm may be required if riders opt to run the Fuel EXe in mullet mode (29er front,
            27.5” rear) or swap out the front fork for a longer 160mm travel unit.

        <p>
            Utilising a unique german made TQ drive unit, the all-new Fuel EXe markets itself as one of the quietest and
            lightest e-mountain bikes available. The HPR50 drive unit delivers a maximum of 50Nm of torque and a peak
            power output of 300 watts. However, it's inside the unit that the point of difference lies. Said to comprise
            just two moving parts, TQ claims that the HPR tips the scales at just 1.85kg, lighter than its direct
            competition in the Specialized 1.1 (1.95kg) and significantly lighter than its big brand competitors, Bosch
            (Performance Line CX - 2.79kg) and Shimano (EP8 - 2.6kg). The lighter weight and lack of moving parts also
            have a secondary benefit of quieter operation. Trek claims the tonality, as in the electrical whirring sound
            of the drive unit, has been significantly reduced as a result, as has the peak dB, or volume emitted from
            the motor.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Trek Fuel EXe is available in three different levels locally. The 9.5 (tested) will set riders back
            $9,499 and is available in either matte grey or blue. The 9.7 is priced at $11,499, while the range-topping
            9.8 will be available for $13,499 in a single deep smoke colourway.
        </p>

        <p class="main">Ride Impressions</p>

        <img src="Images\trek-card.jpg" alt="...">

        <p>
            The motor on this bike is what makes it so interesting. It is barely noticeable when looking at the bike,
            but it’s even more impressive when riding it. In operation, the TQ THR-50 drive unit is so quiet that it is
            easily drowned out by the sound of your tyres rolling beneath you, making it audibly unnoticeable. Throw in
            the maximum assistance of 300 watts and 50Nm of torque on offer, and this bike can climb anything the trail
            throws at you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of the time, I found myself riding in the eco and a blended mode. Not only because it was enough
            assistance for me, but it also had the added benefit of battery saving, allowed me to get some exercise
            done, and stay with my other mates that weren’t riding e-bikes. By doing this, I was getting around 3-3.5
            hours of battery life, which I found was more than enough as my body’s energy drained faster than the
            battery.
        </p>

        <p>
            To reduce the so-called battery anxiety, Trek has included some interesting features that provide peace of
            mind when thinking about the battery range. First is the companion app, which allows riders to tweak the
            settings of the drive unit to eke out that extra little bit of life for the range anxious or turn the wick
            up, to maximise the power output. Trek also offers a range extender that adds 160 Wh of power to extend your
            range by up to 44%. Priced at $899, the range extender is claimed to provide an additional 1.5 hours of
            trail time when used in blended mode. However, it does take the place of the sole bottle mount on the bike.
        </p>

        <p>
            If I’m honest, everything on this bike is so on-point that its components were the only downside. Despite
            commanding a price of $9500, the 9.5 tested here is the base model and comes with somewhat entry-level
            components. When you combine a top-of-the-game motor, battery and frame with entry-level components, the
            magic of the bike does kind of disappear a little, if I’m being completely honest. If I had this bike in my
            stable, I’d swap out the fork for something with more travel, upgrade the brakes, and add an adjustable
            shock at the frame.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, the stock components do their job. I didn’t like the Tektro brakes; even though they feature
            4-piston callipers and have decent braking power, they lack the modulation and finesse of more expensive
            units. The same goes for the RockShox fork and frame suspension. They lack tuneability, which I think is
            essential when riding heavier bikes.
